# Conduct Market Analysis Using Microsoft 365 Business Chat (Automobile Industry)

This exercise demonstrates how to use **Microsoft 365 Business Chat (Copilot)** to conduct a market analysis for the **automobile industry**. By providing clear context and iterating on prompts, you can generate valuable insights on trends, consumer preferences, competitive landscape, and business strategy recommendations.

## Exercise 1 - Conduct a Market Analysis Using Different Conversation Styles

As the **Director of Market Research at a leading automotive company**, you need to prepare a **market analysis report** for the **Senior Leadership Team (SLT)**. Your goal is to identify:
- **Latest industry trends** (EV adoption, autonomous vehicles, sustainability)
- **Consumer preferences** (SUV demand, hybrid vs. electric, pricing sensitivity)
- **Competitive landscape** (market share, key players, emerging markets)
- **Business strategy recommendations** for the upcoming year

### Steps:

1. **Open Microsoft Copilot**
   - In **Microsoft Edge**, go to: [https://Microsoft.com/Copilot](https://Microsoft.com/Copilot)
   - Ensure the toggle is set to **Web** (to access the latest industry data)
   - Select **More Balanced** (default) for a well-rounded analysis

2. **Initial Market Analysis Prompt**
   Enter:
   > "I'm the Director of Market Research for [Your Automotive Company], a leading car manufacturer. Conduct a market analysis of the global automobile industry, including trends in electric vehicles (EVs), consumer preferences, and the competitive landscape."

   - Review the response. It should cover general trends (EV growth, SUV popularity, supply chain challenges)

3. **Refine for Specific Data (Market Share & Consumer Feedback)**
   - The initial response may lack **market share data** and **consumer sentiment**
   - Enter:
     > "Great analysis! Can you also include market share data for top automakers (e.g., Tesla, Toyota, Ford) and recent consumer feedback on EV adoption barriers?"

4. **Request Strategic Insights for Business Planning**
   - Now, ask Copilot to **analyze the data** and provide **actionable insights**:
     > "Based on this data, identify key trends and recommend strategies for our company's next-year business plan (e.g., focus on EV expansion, hybrid models, or new markets)."

5. **Check for Missing Insights**
   - Ensure no critical data is overlooked:
     > "Are there any key factors (e.g., regulatory changes, raw material costs, competitor innovations) that should be included in this analysis? If yes, update the report accordingly."

6. **Finalize the Report**
   - Consolidate all insights:
     > "Please refine the market analysis and business recommendations into a structured report format suitable for executive review."

7. **Compare Conversation Styles**
   - Repeat the process in a **new Copilot session** using **More Creative** mode
   - Observe differences in **tone, depth, and presentation style**

## Exercise 2 - Export the Market Analysis

Once satisfied with the report, export it for further refinement:

1. **Click the Export (↓) icon** on the final response
2. Choose **Word** to save as a `.docx` file (automatically saved to your **Recent Files** in Word)
3. **Rename the file** (e.g., "Automotive_Market_Analysis_2025.docx")
4. **Optional**: Export as **PDF** for easy sharing or **Text** for raw data
